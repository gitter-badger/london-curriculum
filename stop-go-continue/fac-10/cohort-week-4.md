## Stop
- Wash up: Dan will pass on the message upstairs (if it is upstairs people)

## Go
- More workshops like Marina: code-along was great, talking through the code and issues, seeing projection was difficult (close blinds!),
the team should move along at the same time as people can fall behind if they're working through something with the other mentor.

- More open ended projects - nice to allow people to be creative with their projects.
Stopwatch project couldn't be as creative given that it was testing week.

- Backend test workshop - more time should be spent on testing routers and handlers.
There was very little guidance on how to do it yet tests were expected in our projects.
There needs to be greater direction on whether there needs to be continuation of previous learning e.g. front end testing.
There should be greater clarity between good and bad tests instead of just putting in tests. E.g. testing JS functionality is pointless.


- Clarification on using Tape on the front end:
We were told that Tape can be used on the front and back end but we found it very difficult using tape on the front end - reverted back to QUnit.
There needs to be a strong direction for tests. "This is the framework we'll be using, these are the type of tests we'll use, and ignore the rest for now as we'll revisit them next week".
Clear guidelines for next cohort that QUnit for front and Tape for back.

- Mentor's solution for the morning challenge. Should be discussed at the end of the workshop:
Sam's workshop was great but the cohort did not go through the solution together at the end.


## Continue
- Node code along workshop: Marina

- Mentor check-ins: mentors coming around and asking if people needed help. E.g. scanning your code, asking if you are you ok with certain part.

- 2 mentors leading the workshops: One person leading in the code-along and the other going around and checking in on teams.

- Suggesting material to review over the weekend.

- ES6 morning challenge: BUT too much on template literals.
Great that each mini challenge was separate from other challenges. People who were familiar with template literals could just move on.


# Questions

- How good are people at 20/20/20 rule?
Time limits are not adhered to at all. Depends on the level of frustration.
Mentors are more than happy to help. Put it up on Gitter!!
Some people feel that going upstairs is intimidating.
Gitter grabs people when they're free but can take a while.
Going upstairs feels intrusive and rude if people upstairs are into there work.

- More time being spent writing ES6. Even if we don't write it, would be good to be able to recognise ES6 and what it is doing. 

- Was Node supposed to be written in ES6? No. Things don't break in Node if in ES5.
