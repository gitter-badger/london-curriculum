## Minutes

## Stop
- Not buying milk, it shouldn't be the same people always buying the milk.
  - Highlight the fields on the milk/coffee rota so people know who is using what?
  - Ask other people at F&C to contribute?
  - We are going to establish the milk/coffee money pot again.
  - Put the stuff you don't want people to use in a plastic bag (milk etc.)
- Make sure FAC9 and other FACs clean up their own stuff.
- The people responsible for cleaning are responsible for reminding people to clean up their stuff.
- Should we buy a new rack for drying? Environment people are to look into this.
- Team SGC too long (currently 40 mins), lets make it 20 mins (10 mins STG, 10 mins break).
- API calls in projects.
- Generally people are not so keen on the project this week, they spent a lot of time
setting up things like Travis and CodeCov and not as much time coding. It felt like the
only thing different from the week before was making API calls with the Request module.

## Go
- Presentations on Friday should be straight after lunch when people are more alert.
  - lets keep them running up to 5pm so that external speakers can catch some of them
  and possible code review.  
- Can Yoga start earlier on Wednesday so that we can start at 10am sharp.
- 20 min code review before presentations is great, keep doing this.
- Lets have another FAC party!
- Can we be introduced to node modules now/sooner? As a spec on the projects?
- Research day topic on different node modules and what they do.
- More shell/hardware stuff (Node beyond the browser)? FAC10 to consider this for FAC11.
- Extend Bradley's node shell workshop a full day (originally it was a full day workshop).
- We need to tell FAC11 to create their projects for this week in their own repo so
that people are not waiting for Travis to (slowly) run every project one at a time from
the Founders & Coders account.

## Continue
- Error handling workshop (people enjoyed this).
- Well done environment team on the door!!
- General workshops were really good :) (people were not so keen on the projects).
