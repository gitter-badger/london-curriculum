## Stop
1. Starting late
	+ Everyone agrees that we START WORK AT 10
2. stop elephant?
	+ Look into hosting db in diff places. Def think we should do hosted servers rather than local servers
	+ Dan suggests we should try not to use postgres specific features and instead use general sql features
  + We debate whether or not to switch from Elephant
  + Should we just communicate what psql features ElephantSQL does and doesn't support?
	+ We have decided to use Heroku next week and going forward for databases
3. Workshops that focus on using SELECT on simple DBs
	+ Oli says that the challenges commonly made us focus on pretty simple stuff selecting from simple DBs
  + Finn says that the build scripts all had a comment saying `we're hardcoding ids here cause we know what they will be, but actually you would write a script to do it` with no info on how to write that actual script.
  + Often useful stuff in workshops right at the end, but they're so far down that we don't get there.
  + How do we improve that for next cohort?  
	ANS: edit/rewrite the workshops to cut out the repetition.
  + Less of a jump between difficulty of workshops to difficulty of projects?
4. Less open ended project for this week
	+ Really hard to gauge what we should do for a project without knowledge of SQL
  + Maybe just knowing more bout weak entities would help?
  + Consensus seems to be that information about weak entities in SQL and how SQL works will solve this problem, so we will keep open ended-ness but with more info beforehand
  + More tutelage on how to post things from a form to a database.  
	+ NOTE TO OURSELVES: when we teach FAC11 just keep all this in mind, make sure they know about posting from a form to a DB
5. Stop writing confusing instructions
	+ Make sure we know what we want to be getting from a query so that we know better how to write it
  + Make sure the instructions for what each task contains is clear
  + How will we deal with this for the next cohort? (we will have our first curriculum meeting first day back from reading week)

## Go
1. Clarify testing research topic
	+ Just make sure what you're supposed to research for this topic, what is expected of the researchers and what we will be doing in the project
2. Code along (PG etc)
	+ Make the Tuesday morning workshop a code along rather than just a demonstration.
  + KEY WORD: MAGIC -> lots of people still feel like they don't understand what a database is, where it is, how it exists. We need to make this stuff clear.
    * we have moved on to talking about what we do when something goes wrong
    	* How long do we spend holding up the workshop when people have technical problems?
		* Do we just make sure at least half of the people have it working and then we pair?
		* We moved on due to time, come back to this.
3. Add repos to FAC10 research
	+ Just make sure people merge your PRs.
4. Have prior reading for SQL
	+ Some people feel they would have benefited from some weekend reading before SQL week
	+ Some people feel setting reading in advanced discriminates against people who have other commitments
	+ Shall we bring Steve in to do the talk on SQL for FAC11?
	+ Shall we cut into research time to do more workshops?
5. Workshops should not teach bad practices
	+ We all agree that where possible we should not learn bad practices in workshops
6. Consolidate resources etc
	+ Make sure that people are looking over workshops before they are put forth to be done by people on the course so that little bits of info aren't missed.
7. DAN! Clarify weeks 10-16 content
	+ DAN TO TELL US NEXT WEEK
8. Explain files in database folder
	+ RELATES TO MAGIC OF DATABASES
  + We need to make sure we understand what is in DB_connect and DB_build files.
  + Lucy(FAC9) suggests that you talk through the code and what you think it's doing with someone on your cohort who understands it better
9. More clarification of what Mentors will be teaching in spotlight workshops
