## Group Action points

### Stop
   - don't forget to go over the challenge/solutions at the end of the challenge

### Go
 - less general/simple introduction to testing and TDD
   - too large a step between fizzbuzz/romaniser and a stopwatch

### Continue
  - Good passive support from mentors

## Minutes

### Stop

  - Stop the stopwatch project
    - some thought it was too challenging
    - difficult to build incrementally
    - a spike is good in theory but it took so long for people to create the stopwatch in the spike that it took up a large         part of the project.
    - do a workshop on async testing instead of ramaniser workshop so they have experience of async testing before they start       the project.

  - Stop not reviewing challenges
    - don't forget to go over the challenge/solutions at the end of the challenge

  - Please be quieter during README/Research time

  - Spikes as a research topic is a bit (they finished)

### Go

  - include a more general introduction to testing at the beginning of the week (technologies and methodologies)
    - just mention that these other technologies and methodologies exist

  - examples of how to deal with real project issues
    - useful for mentors to show examples and give more support
    - global variables

  - better cleaning up after ourselves
    - it's not the person on the cleaning rota's job to clean up pots and cups etc.

  - less general/simple introduction to testing
    - too large a step between fizzbuzz/romaniser and a stopwatch

  - have a code-along demonstration of people doing TDD (this could be the ramaniser challenge)
    - could the mentors provide and go through a solution with the group at the end

  - Huw Davies presentation was too late in the day, could it have been earlier?
    - They wanted to use some of the points that were raised in the talk in their code

  - Waterfall function needed an explanation of callbacks and async beforehand and more than 1 hour to complete.

### Continue

  - researching topics and presenting

  - mentors in the room ready to field questions sat on the sofa. Constantly reminding people that you are there if they need     support and have questions.

  - challenging projects
