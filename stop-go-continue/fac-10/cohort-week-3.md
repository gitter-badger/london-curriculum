## Minutes

### Stop
+ not cleaning up after yourself

+ all day workshops
  + as they can be brain melting (towards end of the day not taking in information). Useful, but plugging at same thing all day is difficult. With more complex concepts it's nice to have a bit of break. Same amount of time in total but split into chunks would be good.

### Go
+ more time for morning challenges and walk us through mentor's solution
  + seeing snippets of other people's code means that you understand the function and what it does, but not how it links to other functions in the code. Maybe a better way is to cast solutions of 1 or 2 teams and then walk through a mentor's solution. Starting with a broken one and fixing it together is more helpful than working through a perfect one.
  + counter arg from mentor: morning challenge should be a challenge. It's ok to not finish and not to know the solution. It's to put some ideas in your brain for when you encounter these ideas in coming weeks. It's good practice for coding exercises in job interviews


 + clarity of which workshop to do - github vs gitter
  + confusion caused by up to date version being posted in gitter on the day, which differs form version in master reference.
  + Solution: make sure the master reference up to date

+ put Chromecast on founder I / improve FAC internet.
  + The engineer who came this week may have solved this.


+ get a thunderbolt cable so that macbook airs can use to HDMI cable for casting if internet is down

+ use lollipops more often. The question 'anyone wanna cast?' - is a leading question which leads to people with non-working solutions being hesitant to cast.


### Continue
+ in-depth workshops
+ teaching higher-level stuff like architecting our code
+ freestyle api projects - open ended projects let you be creative/ make your own user stories.
+ mentor catch ups: nice
+ workshops where we go over the material with mentors afterwards in little chunks (give some content, leave people to work through it for a set time, then come together to show solutions)
