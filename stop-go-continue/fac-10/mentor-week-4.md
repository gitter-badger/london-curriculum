### Stop
+ The amount of process we have for updating the coursebook is overkill – if the title of a PR describes exactly what it does, then the absence of a further description definitely shouldn't be a blocking issue. And there were a few times that PRs were approved and not merged, which was a bit baffling. Remember points one and four (and arguably two) of the agile manifesto

### Go
+ Probably good to have a rota up front with two people assigned to each day – otherwise it's easy for stuff to slip between the gaps and end up realising at the last minute that you don't have any tutors arranged (easier said than done)
+ It'd be great to tweak the schedule slightly for research afternoon - right now it's just shown as one big block of time from 14.00-18.00. Making it explicit when presentations start would be handy - probably 4.30-5.30 as the timings slip pretty

### Continue
+ Responding to students' needs - we had to change the plan slightly after we got ahead of schedule on Day One and ended up doing the modularisation challenge two days early, which resulted in having to create some new materials and shuffle things around. But if anything, that's a positive – if the group's learning faster than we planned and we're able to push ahead and create new resources to fill the gap


**Action points**
+ Better communication about things that will have an effect on every week (e.g. ideal week structure, where everything lives in the master reference, making the contributing process as simple and transparentas possible). This should be done by cohort members during the curriculum planning phase, and the Course Coordinator should provide mentors with updates if anything has changed before their week starts.
