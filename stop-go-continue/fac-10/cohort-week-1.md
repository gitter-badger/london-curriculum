## Minutes

### Stop
+ Rubbish chairs - for environmental concerns, try getting better chairs
+ Confusion about tea / coffee / milk situation - what is communal, what is not?
  + We (mentors) need to put the tally sheet on the wall
  + We all seem to be going through quite a lot of coffee, if we all chipped in then we could get more coffee, and better coffee, by buying in bulk
+ Cold - draft from the door, there is one heater
  + Feel free to move the heaters downstairs - the heat travels upstairs so alumni should be fine without it
  + Environment task group - finally get the door fixed

### Go
+ Git shortcuts - pepper more throughout the rest of the weeks?
  + Gitflow walkthrough this afternoon
  + Mentors to add a few commands to the beginning of each week / each project (Jen can help with this)
+ Confusion about tabindex. Examples were really unclear in the morning challenge. Use an example which isn't already tab-able by default (input fields). There was still some confusion during the projects with people not understanding how to tab through the page to the subheadings.
  + Just wanted to point you to the existance of tabindex, but it wasn't necessarily going so in-depth about all the ways you could use it. But I do take that on board.
  + You are incredibly welcome to raise an issue
+ More about BEM in precourse reading - one person on the team knew this, but it would have been really helpful if we'd all known how (i.e. not as a research topic?)
  + Mentors did discuss this - it was put in a research topic to encourage the idea a way that you _could_ do things, and accidentally encouraging you to think of it as the way that you _should_. Maybe this needs rethinking
  + Mentors to send out survey about precourse to gather useful feedback data
+ Make git workflow workshop more team based. We ended up doing it all on our own, even if we pair programmed it, it would have been working on your own in terms of working on the repo you were working on. Person 1 PR, person 2 merge it. There were problems with people merging to master during projects.
+ Review git workshop doc. It's really easy to get lost in it. It's really easy to make assumptions based on the previous step you have just made.
  + Have a note at the top? Saying: 'this doc is very sequential' so make sure you do each step
  + Ended up cloning the original repo (not the forked version) which broke something way down the line
  + Maybe it is worth us iteratively improving the course as we go, rather than leaving all the curriculum planning at the end. Maybe 2 people who are more passionate about github can take on the responsibility for improving these week 1 workshops right now, rather than leaving it til the end of the course, or leaving it to just the most passionate people to do the improvements.
    + We (mentors) are wary of giving people more work. You all have a lot on your plate, and this is only week 1. The course gets more intense. People taking that task on now is probably going to be really unhealthy in terms of workload.
  + There is time for that baked into the course, so don't worry about having your chance to contribute.
  + Everyone should raise issues as they go! If you feel particularly passionately and you feel like you have time, you're also welcome to submit PRs as you go.
  + Be aware of open source ettiquette, asking authors or primary contributors whether they are happy to accept PRs, or whether you could be added as contributors. _But_ these are Founders and Coders resources, and they are yours to submit PRs to directly.
+ Can we have a short project plan review with mentor e.g. after 1 hour of being in groups, having a catch up with a mentor
  + As a mentor, if I gave you the tools and the outline, if you wanted to come to me for advice about how to go about it, I would feel like I was too involved in your decisions. If you feel like you're going into a project and you feel like it's not clear how you are supposed to go into it and start it, in a way that's a problem with our planning and our provision of materials for you. Really, we just want feedback if there is anything unclear about the project itself. You will find that as the weeks go on, you will get a lot more confident about the steps to completion.
  + We try to emphasise there is no wrong answer, and sometimes you get more out of making mistakes. One thing you will encounter in the future is code tests to get a job. I felt an overwhelming sense of 'Am I doing it right?' In a way, one of the hardest things is that you can't ask any questions or get any advice. It's not bad to get used to that feeling now. It feels a lot more awkward when you have to get used to that with an employer.
  + Every week you will see that people ask 'Can we get a bit more support?' and we say 'No, _and here's why_'. It's good for you to learn to be autonomous.
+ Do fun things together - would be nice to do stuff together, as a cohort or as a group in FAC
  + Breakfast at Yvonne's next week
+ Code review of personal websites before week 1 by a mentor? These workshops get us looking at our websites, which we haven't looked at in months
  + Assign each other during precourse?
  + It would have freaked me out if I had had people code reviewing me before I came here. I already felt really nervous about starting the course, and I think that would have made it worse.
  + Maybe just notify people that FAC will begin with workshops on your websites. Give people a heads up to look at their own websites again before day 1?
+ _All_ of Udacity's git course should be on precourse - it's easy to think that you know enough with lesson 1, but the git workshop on day 1 is overwhelming and then you realise "oh, that part of the workshop is in part 2 of the Udacity course...which we didn't do".
  + When we were planning precourse & week 1, we didn't want to throw too much at you. Udacity lesson 1 is more of an intro to what git _is_, and we then build on the commands and how to use it during the week 1 workshop.
  + Maybe the workshop just needs improvements? You learn a lot more by going through the flow when you're in teams, than you would by yourself in the precourse. We will have a workflow walkthrough this afternoon. Hopefully that might clear some things up.
  + Having gh-pages in the prereqs now (FAC9 didn't have that) might mean that they've had more experience with it than us and could handle something more? Maybe we'll find out with the survey.

### Continue
+ Name game & community talk - meet whole FAC community in week 1
+ Accessibility focus - good to begin the course with this and give us a focus on _why_ we are building websites
+ FAC alumni reviewing our code in detail to begin the course. Whereas I would have freaked out at someone reviewing my code beforehand, it was really useful while in this environment.
  + If you can't manage to get that many alumni in the weeks to come, at least it was there to start us off with fundamentals like how we use github, to make sure we're doing things right going forward.
+ Talk on community (Mark's talk) :+1:
+ Morning challenges - nice to get a chance to work with different people, reinforced things we've learned before, went through solutions together
+ Pair programming - good to have this consistently, since we can learn a lot from each other
  + Sometimes this takes time to get used to, so that's good to hear
+ Love the teamwork aspect. A lot of us come from coding at home in our room. Other people know things that we don't know, and we can share it all.
