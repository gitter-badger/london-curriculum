## Cleaning Rota

Every week someone is responsible for the following cleaning tasks:

- Emptying the kitchen waste and recyling bins
- Emptying the bathroom bin
- Washing the kitchen towel
- Washing the bathroom hand towel
- Watering the plants

It is your responsibility to monitor these things during your week so that you do them
as and when they are needed.
