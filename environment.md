# ENVIRONMENT

14 Palmers road is now your space. You can use the space whenever you like in accordance with the calendar. You are also responsible for keeping the place clean, tidy and secure.

## Next door

No.15 is where DWYL are based along with some freelancers and start ups.

## Upstairs

Upstairs is a space for alumni to use to work and study. There is also a printer here that you can use.

## Downstairs

Downstairs is the main learning space for the cohort 10am-6pm Monday-Friday. It is also used for the Monday and Tuesday night meet ups.

## Kitchen

The kitchen has a working microwave, hob, kettle and coffee machine. The oven upon which the hob sits is not operational. Tea, milk and coffee are bought and consumed communally. There is a wall chart to keep track of who has been buying these so that the responsibility is shared. You may use the fridge for other items but please ensure to be mindful of removing food if you don’t intend on eating before it turns bad. Washing up liquid should be bought by the Environment business development team, please inform them when stocks are low.

## Bathroom

No.14 has a toilet and separate shower room. Spare toilet roll is stored in the shower room and supplies should be bought in bulk by the Environment business development team, please inform them when stocks are low. The same goes for hand soap. The hand towel in the bathroom should be according to the rota.

## Cleaning

The space is cleaned professionally every Monday morning. However, as a cohort you are responsible for keeping the space clean and tidy. There is a cleaning rota which entails doing the bins, towel washing and plant watering for the week. You must empty the rubbish, recycling and bathroom bins and putting full bags in the collection bins past no.14 on the left. As well as washing the bathroom and kitchen hand towels throughout the week. Please also water the plants in the space appropriately (top tip for those without green fingers: if the soil is damp to touch then it probably doesn’t need watering, otherwise give it some H20).

## Locking up / Keys

If you are going to be the last in the space ensure you have some keys to lock up. Before locking up ensure that all heaters are off and that the back door by the toilet is secure.

You can get keys cut (ask someone who already has some to borrow theirs to get them cut) so that you have your own set should you see this as useful. This may be the case if you intend on coming in early or staying late.

## Leaving things in the space

There are pigeon holes that you may use to leave small items at FAC. However it is discouraged to leave high value items like laptops overnight.

## Bikes

Should you cycle to FAC you can lock your bike on bike racks on Palmers Road. They are situated beyond no.14 near the communal bins. It is recommended that you lock your wheels.

## Parcels

We regularly sign for parcels for people in the space or next door. If you have signed for a parcel please leave it on the table near the door. If you have had something delivered to FAC and can’t find it ask the building porters. There are 2 porters on Palmers road and it’s worth checking both. If you need to locate these ask someone in the space to direct you to them.

## Fire

In the event of a fire everyone should assemble down Palmers Road bin store/ taller blocks of flats.
